Companies like Google, H2O, DataRobot are making huge investments with AutoML as their front cover. In fact, they managed to do well on Gartner’s magic quadrant and secure venture funding due the same fact because it sounds revolutionary.

But the real question here is, How receptive the Data science community has been in adopting these AutoML tools? Are they really being used in real life or just being a marketing material? These questions are quite hard to answer at any level.

This notebook tries to leverage a few questions in the Kaggle 2019 Survey to understand the who and what part of AutoML.

Considering AutoML itself a very small niche, I’ve attempted to carve out the niche from this Huge Survey.
